# eCommerce Admin

An admin dashboard for users to add and edit products as well as see data for their ecommerce store.

## ðŸ¤” Why I built this?

I have some interest in eCommerce and online store so I wanted to try to build one. Instead of creating one where users can post their own items as a marketplace, I wanted this to be more like a singular shop that allows a user to control it via an external hub that also includes analytics. This is the admin side of the shop and the frontend store can be visited <a href="https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-store">here</a>

## Preview

## Getting Started

Things you will need:

- Clerk account
- Cloudinary account (for image storing)
- PlanetScale account
- Stripe account

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-admin.git
```

2. Install dependencies with Node Package Manager

```
npm install
```

3. Copy the .env files from the .env.example in the root

```
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update the TOKEN secrets!

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY from Clerk.

The SIGN_IN_URL through to SIGN_UP_URL can all stay the same.

DATA_URL from PlanetScale.

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME from Cloudinary.

STRIPE_API_KEY from Stripe.

While developing, FRONTEND_STORE_URL can stay the same as you will need to have two applications running. The admin will be the first on localhost:3000 and when you start the second application, it will run on localhost:3001 as :3000 is in use.

5. Start up the development server

```
npm run dev
```

6. Open the project in the browser at localhost:3000!
